<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

My journey into the Sphere started in March 2023, when I came across the interesting computer "Sphere 1" produced and marketed from Bountiful, Utah, beginning around 1975.

I found this reference on a [Hackaday page](https://hackaday.com/2023/03/11/a-love-letter-to-the-sphere-computer/), which led me to Ben Zott's fantastic resource "http://sphere.computer”

With an interest in retro computing, but a very elementary electronics knowledge, I decided that I had to build one, as no-one had attempted to re-create one from scratch since the original build days.

The main issue is that the documentation is sparse, with the computers even sparser!

This is the story of how I got on, my trials and tribulations and (hopefully) in time, the results of my labours.

<!-- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS -->
## Acknowledgments

I have to give my heartfelt thanks to Ben Zott, who has been a sounding board for me throughout this project, answering my emails, and checking his Sphere-1 CPU/2 board to answer questions, and offering thoughts as to why things “were like they were” ! Without him, I would never have got as far as I have.
