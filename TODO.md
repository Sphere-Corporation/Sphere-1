TO DO List

Note that this is a non-ordered list (mainly of ideas to create the vision of the Sphere-1 computer living again)


- [ ] 3D-printed chassis
- [ ] Improve motherboards to include edge connectors (not ribbon)
- [ ] Produce Sphere Corporation stickers
- [ ] Include the Keyboard converter onboard
- [ ] Arduino-based monitor emulator
- [ ] TTF Sphere-1 font  * Started *
- [ ] Move "build" infrastructure to CONVERT project and rename project to "BUILD"

Some of these may evolve into projects in their own right
